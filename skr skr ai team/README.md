# Smart Parking Solution
### 1)Parking Detection Algorithm
### 2)Automated Parking Fine System

# Concept

  Smart Parking solution that shows drivers where the nearest available open space parking spot is. With this mobile application, the location of a driver will be detected and cameras which are placed all over the city will be utilised with the implementation of image processing algorithms on detecting available and occupied parking spots. Images are captured through these cameras and sent over to the mobile application for driversâ€™ information. The budget to this project is estimated to be quite high, but the business expects significant amount of downloads for the mobile application and make more in return through advertisements on it. Furthermore, this project delivers effective solutions to reduce the traffic congestion in every part of the city and looks forward to corporate with government. 
  
  On the other hand, fine will be given automatically to the drivers who parks their cars illegally. The licence plate recognition system will be used to analyse the status of the car parked (referring to the parkiing database) by using the camera as mentioned. AI approach on MLP (Multilayered Perceptron) is utilised to learn from the database on some specified information (weather, estimated walking time and etc) to study their parking behaviors. Summons/Fine will be issued to the illegal parking driver based on the AI approach as mentioned.   
  
  For future plans, the capitals such as cameras can be utilised for recording crimes and accidents which declines the crime rate effectively and other uses.
